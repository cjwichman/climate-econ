    "text": "externalities\nAn externality results when the actions of one individual (or firm) have a direct, unintentional, and uncompensated effect on the well-being of other individuals or the profits of other firms. (Importantly, price changes are not externalities because the consequences of a price change are already accounted for within the market.)\nExternalities can be positive or negative. In the case of GHG emissions, the externality is negative because the costs of emissions are not reflected in the prices we pay for goods and services. This augments our standard demand model when were thinking about, say, the market for gasoline consumption. Gasoline is a good motivating example because it creates several salient externalities: GHG emissions, local air pollution from tailpipe emissions, traffic congestion, and accident externalities. Incidentally, recent research suggests that the social cost of gasoline consumption is just under $4 per gallon Linn et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The market for gasoline with externalities\n\n\nConsider Figure 5, the private equilibrium level is \\(q^\\star\\) and \\(p^*\\) where the supply (or private marginal cost) curve and the demand (or private marginal benefit) curve intersect. But, we know gasoline consumption generates externalities. The social marginal cost (SMC) curve reflects the total costs to society that are associated with gasoline consumption (inclusive of GHG emissions). Those externalities are represented by the vertical difference between the private marginal cost curve and the social marginal cost curve, which is called the marginal external damages (MD) of gasoline consumption. In the figure, \\(MD=\\$3\\) implies that there are $3 of external costs generated for every gallon of gasoline consumed.\n\nOperating at the privately optimal point of consumption results in deadweight loss to society, which reflects the social welfare loss of failure to incorporate external costs into the price of gasoline. Deadweight loss is the welfare loss borne by people outside of the market.\nIf we were to incorporate the social cost of gasoline consumption into the price of gasoline, the supply curve would shift up by the amount of the marginal external damages. This would result in a new equilibrium level of consumption, \\(q_S^\\star\\), at the socially optimal price, \\(p_S^\\star\\). At this point, consumers would have to pay more (in this case, 5 dollars per gallon), which would reduce the quantity of gasoline consumed.\n\nFigure 5 is one of the most important figures in environmental economics because it demonstrates that society will consume and produce too much of goods that generate negative externalities, which is often the case that we care about when economic activity generates environmental harm. Later on, we will consider different policy instruments that attempt to achieve the socially optimal quantity through the use of taxes, subsidies, regulations, or designing markets that internalize the external costs of economic activity."

    "text": "public goods\nOne primary reason that markets fail to account for the social costs of GHG emissions is that GHG mitigation is a public good. If the US were to abate GHG emissions, the benefits would be shared by everyone in the world. But, the costs of abatement would be borne by US citizens. As a result, the US has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of other countries to reduce emissions.\nPublic goods are characterized by two key features:\n\nNon-rivalry: One person’s consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others to consume.\nNon-excludability: Others cannot be excluded from consuming the good.\n\nExamples of pure public goods include clean air, national defense, Wikipedia, and so forth.\nPrivate goods are rivalrous and excludable. I can exclude you from consuming my private goods (e.g., the peanut butter and jelly sandwich I eat for lunch on most days). And, if I eat my sandwich, there is nothing left for you to eat.\nTwo other classes of goods are relevant for our purposes:\n\nCommon pool resources: Common pool resources are rivalrous but non-excludable. For example, fish in the ocean are rivalrous because if I catch a fish, you cannot catch it. But, the ocean is non-excludable because it is impossible to prevent people from fishing in the ocean.\nClub goods: Club goods are non-rivalrous but excludable. For example, a private park is non-rivalrous because if I am in the park, you can also be in the park. But, the park is excludable because I can prevent you from entering the park.\n\nWhen modeling equilibrium supply of public goods, we need to account for the nonrival nature of public goods. In Figure 6, there are two marginal benefit curves for different people that reflect how much they value flood protection. Imagine these two individuals live in a coastal community and face different risks of sea-level rise because of the elevation of their property, the value of their home, and so forth. The figure represents their willingness-to-pay for a seawall that provides reduced risk of flooding during hurricanes. Because both people can simultaneously enjoy the seawall, we need to add up their marginal benefits curves vertically to understand the aggregate benefits that each quantity of trips provides.2 This vertical summation results in the social marginal benefit curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Modeling public goods\n\n\nThe supply curve reflects the marginal cost of that the community bears in providing the public good (e.g., building materials, labor, and maintenance costs). Imagine that both person A and B are the people who actually have to build the wall. Person A is only willing-to-pay up to \\(MB_A\\) to build the wall, resulting in the height \\(Q_A\\) of the seawall, while person B is willing-to-pay up to \\(MB_B\\), resulting in \\(Q_B\\). Person A might recognize that Person B has a higher valuation of the seawall and, if Person B provides \\(Q_B\\) feet of the seawall, then Person A’s home is protected. This provides Person A with the incentive to free ride on the contribution of Person B.\nBut, this free-riding behavior will result in underprovision of the seawall. In order to determine the socially optimal level of provision, we need to add up vertically both people’s willingness-to-pay for the seawall and find where the resulting social marginal benefit curve intersects with the marginal cost curve. This intersection point is the socially optimal level of provision, represented by \\(Q^\\star\\) in Figure 6. The socially optimal level of provision maximizes the net benefits of the seawall to society by incorporating the value that both individuals place on the seawall."

This suggests that parties acting in their own self-interest will bargain to achieve the socially optimal solution\nThe Coase Theorem, while potentially powerful in some settings, is unlikely to be useful for addressing climate change. Why? Because the Coase Theorem requires well-defined property rights (who owns the right to emit GHGs into the atmosphere?) and low transaction costs (if, say, a company wanted to emit GHGs as a result of their operations, they would have to compensate all parties affected by their solution)."

This occurs because the aggregate demand curve will actually be “kinked” because of the different intercepts of the individual demand curves (e.g., above a price of $6, there are only two demand curves to add together; above a price of $7, there is only one demand curve to consider). This means that the slope of the curve will change above these prices although I’ve avoided this discussion for clarity.↩︎\nRecall that when we are dealing with private goods, we add up demand curves horizontally to determine the aggregate demand curve. We do this because of the rivalrous nature of private goods. Only one person can receive the benefits of consuming a single apple. With public goods, this calculus changes because multiple people can enjoy the same quantity of, say, GHG mitigation.↩︎"

    "text": "valuing mortality risk\nOften, one of the biggest benefits of any environmental regulation is the reduction in deaths that result from environmental pollution. Climate change is no different. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves, tropical cyclones, drought (which can lead to crop failure and food insecurity), forest fires, and so forth. These events will increase the risk of death for people around the world. Reducing GHG emissions will reduce the risk of these events, which will reduce the risk of death. One way to value that benefit is to use the value of a statistical life (VSL) (also known as the value of mortality risk reductions). The VSL is the amount of money that a person is willing to pay to reduce their risk of death by a small amount. The way it is calculated is as follows. Imagine gathering 100,000 people. Then, ask each of them how much they would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of death by 1 in 100,000 that year.1 If the average person is willing to pay $100 for a reducing the risk of death by 0.001%, then multiplying that by the number of people in the group (100,000) gives us a VSL estimate of $10,000,000. This value is approximately the current value used by the US government to value mortality risk reductions (see EPA’s guidance here)."

The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would need to be invested today at a given interest rate to yield that future payment.\nWe calculate the PV of a single value in the future using the following formula:\n\\[PV(b) = \\frac{b}{(1 + r)^t}\\]\nwhere \\(b\\) is the future value of the payment, \\(r\\) is the discount rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years until the payment is received. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of money in the future.\nWe can also calculate the PV of a stream of future benefits using the following formula:\n\\[PV(b_t) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{b_t}{(1 + r)^t}\\]\nwhere \\(b_t\\) is the amount of benefits received in each year \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) is the total number of years over which benefits are received. This is the same as the single period formula, but we repeat that formula for each year benefits accrue.\nNote, you can also calculate the PV of a stream of future costs using a “continuous time” version of the formula:\n\\[PV(b_t) = b_t \\exp(-rt)\\]\nThe basic idea behind discounting is that we are impatient. We would prefer to receive money now, rather than in the future. So, we discount future benefits and costs to reflect our degree of impatience. This idea stems from the fact that we can earn interest on money today. With a 5% interest rate, we should be indifferent between $100 today and $105 a year from now, because we could invest that $100 and earn $5 of interest payments in one year. Discounting just reverses that same idea. Nominal dollar amounts received in the future will be worth less than nominal dollar amounts received today. This is especially important with climate change because many of the benefits of climate change mitigation will occur very far in the future, while the costs will be borne today."

    "text": "what social discount rate should we use?\nChoosing a value for the social discount rate is a tricky business that can be informed just as much by ethics and philosophy as it can by economics.\n\nHistorically, the federal government typically used two discount rates for benefit-cost analysis: 3% and 7%. The 3% rate is used to reflect the opportunity cost of consumption, while the 7% rate is used to reflect the opportunity cost of capital investment.\nAlternative rationales depend on moral or ethical considerations in choosing the parameters for the Ramsey equation. The 2007 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change used a social discount rate of 1.4%. These choices were made to reflect the following:\n\n\\(\\delta=0.1\\%\\) reflects the idea that we should value future generations’ welfare almost equally to our own.\n\\(\\eta=1\\) reflects the idea that we should value an additional dollar of consumption equally, regardless of how wealthy we are. The choice of \\(\\eta=1\\) was particularly conversial. Many economists believe that \\(\\eta\\) should be larger than 1, which would imply that we should value an additional dollar of consumption more highly as we become wealthier. This would imply that we should use a higher discount rate.\n\\(g=1.3\\%\\) reflects the idea that we expect consumption per capita to grow at 1.3% per year.\n\n\nIn 2023, the US Government adopted new guidelines for discounting (and conducting benefit-cost analysis, more generally) in a very wonky document titled “Circular A-4”. Several arguments for discounting that pertain to climate change are presented in Circular A-4:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircular A-4 arguments for a prescriptive approach to long-term discounting\n\n\n\nSome believe that it is ethically impermissible to discount the utility of future generations. That is, government should treat all generations equally. Even under an approach that does not discount the utility of future generations, it is often appropriate to discount longterm consumption benefits and costs—although at a lower rate than the near-term effects more likely to fall on a single generation—if there is an expectation that future generations will be wealthier and thus will value a marginal dollar of benefits or costs by less than those alive today, or if there is a non-zero probability of sufficiently catastrophic risks. To account for these special ethical considerations, an extensive literature uses a “prescriptive” approach to long-term discounting, determining the appropriate degree of weight that society should place on the welfare of future generations. (Circular A-4, pp. 80)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircular A-4 arguments for using a lower/declining rate for long-term discounting\n\n\n\nA distinct reason for discounting the benefits and costs accruing to future generations at a lower rate is uncertainty about the appropriate value of the discount rate. Private market rates provide a reasonably reliable reference for determining the rate at which society is willing to trade consumption over time within a few decades, but for extremely long time periods no comparable private rates exist. Because future changes in the social rate of time preference are uncertain but correlated over time, the certainty-equivalent discount rate will have a declining schedule. The appropriate discount rate declines because it is the average of the cumulative discount factors, not an average of the discount rates, that matters. (Circular A-4, pp. 80)"

    "text": "uncertainty and the discount rate\nProjecting future costs and benefits is inherently uncertain. When using the Ramsey equation, we need to make assumptions about the growth rate of consumption per capita over centuries. When focused on a descriptive approach, the discount rate might reflect changes in interests rates that may be driven by uncertain future monetary policy.\nThe key point to remember is that uncertainty in the discount rate provides justification for using a lower discount rate.\nImagine today, we use a 4% discount rate, but that discount rate has an equally likely chance of becoming 1% or 7% in 100 years. What discount rate should we use today to reflect that uncertainty?\nWe can work through an example to define the certainty-equivalent discount rate. The certainty-equivalent discount rate is the discount rate that would make us indifferent between that rate and taking the gamble on the uncertain rate.\nThe PV of receiving $1000 in 100 years for each rate is:\n\n\nTable 1: Discount rates to calculate certainty equivalents\n\n\ndiscount rate\nnominal value\ndiscounted value\n\n\n\n\n1%\n$1000\n$367.88\n\n\n4%\n$1000\n$18.32\n\n\n7%\n$1000\n$0.91\n\n\n\n\nCan we just use the average of the discounted values for the 1% and 7% rates (i.e., \\(\\bar{PV}_{100}\\) ($367.88 + $0.91) / 2 = $184.40) as the certainty-equivalent discount rate? The short answer is no, and the reason depends on the shape of the present-value formula.1\nBut! We can calculate the certainty-equivalent discount rate by comparing the average of the two discounted values across adjacent years (i.e., comparing year 100 vs. 101).\n\nPV of $1000 in 101 years at 1% discount rate: $364.22\nPV of $1000 in 101 years at 7% discount rate: $0.85\nAverage of the two above values, \\(\\bar{PV}_{101}\\): ($364.22 + $0.85)/2 = $182.53\n\nThen, we can calculate the certainty-equivalent discount rate by dividing the average of the two discounted values across two adjacent years:\n\\[ \\frac{\\bar{PV}_{100}}{\\bar{PV}_{101}} = \\frac{\\$184.40}{\\$182.53} = 1.01024... = (1+r) \\] \\[ \\implies r \\approx 1.02\\% \\]\nThis value is the certainty-equivalent discount rate for the 50-50 chance of seeing a 1% or 7% discount rate in 100 years. This value is clearly much lower than 4%, which is the average of the two rates. If there is uncertainty in the discount rate, that leads to a much lower certainty-equivalent discount rate that we should use in our benefit-cost analysis."

Until very recenntly, the federal government has used a value of roughly $51/ton (with some notable changes across political administrations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2023, the current value of the SCC used in federal regulatory analysis is $190/ton at a 2% discount rate (Environmental Protection Agency 2023).\n\n\n\nIt is important to distinguish climate impacts from climate damages:\n\nClimate impacts are the physical changes to the climate system that result from GHG emissions. For example, the melting of glaciers, the increase in global surface temperature, the increase in sea level, and so forth.\nClimate damages are the monetized economic costs that result from climate impacts. For example, declines in agricultural productivity, damages to coastal property, the loss of human life, and so forth.\n\nThe way to use the SCC is straightforward. Imagine a regulation is predicted to reduce GHG emissions by 10,000 tons. We can multiply that reduction in emissions by the SCC to arrive at the total present value of the damages that are avoided by reducing emissions (e.g., $51/ton \\(\\times\\) 10,000 tons). This estimate is the monetized economic benefits of reducing 10,000 tons of GHG emissions.\nThe following video provides a brief overview of the SCC:"

But, there is (somewhat) limited ability for using historical data to understand how society will adapt to climate change. Adaptation would change the shape of \\(f()\\). If \\(y\\) is heat-related mortality, then the shape of \\(f()\\) might change as we society uses more air conditioning. That is, put simply, the relationship between temperature and mortality might be different in the future than it is today.\nWe can use some “cross-sectional” comparisons (i.e., giving the US Mexico’s climate) to understand how \\(f()\\) might change but these comparisons are limited because we cannot control for all of the other differences between the US and Mexico.\nMoreover, we can only estimate the relationship between temperature and outcomes for which we have good data. Certain outcomes, including a lot of non-market impacts of climate change, do not have good data precisely because they are not traded in markets."

    "text": "Climate change is a “missing markets” problem. Reducing GHG emissions provides benefits to society, but there is no formal mechanism to generate demand for emissions. But, we can model climate policies as if they operate as a demand curve for emissions reductions or GHG abatement.\nEconomists tend to prefer market-based solutions for reducing GHGs. Two primary market-based solutions are carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems. Both of these solutions are based on the idea of putting a price on carbon emissions. The idea is that if we put a price on carbon emissions, then firms will emit less carbon. This is because emitting carbon will become more expensive, and people will demand less of carbon-intensive goods and services and firms will be less interested in producing them.\nTo understand how to compare different policies that reducing GHG emissions, it is helpful to remind ourselves what it is we’re trying to do. We want to maximize the net benefits of GHG abatment, which involves balancing the benefits of GHG abatement (i.e., reducing climate change) with the costs of abatement. Net benefits are maximized when the marginal benefits of abatement equal the marginal costs of abatement. This is what we refer to as the socially optimal, or “efficient,” level of GHG abatement.\nPolicies to reduce GHG emissions attempt to do so at least cost. Imagine we know what level of GHG emissions we want to achieve—perhaps this is getting to “net zero” emissions or reducing emissions enough to keep us on track to meet agreements laid out in the Paris Accord. There are potentially many ways to reduce emissions to that level, but we want to find a way to reduce emissions in the least costly way to society. As a result, we often end up comparing and contrasting different policies to reduce emissions in terms of their costs of achieving a given emissions reduction."

    "text": "will we run out of fossil fuels?\nCovert, Greenstone, and Knittel (2016) argue that we are probably not going to stop using fossil fuels anytime soon based on market incentives alone. They pose two theories and evaluate them.\n\nThe supply theory for getting of fossil fuels suggests that as we extract more fossil fuels, the cost of extraction will rise. This is because we will have extracted the easiest-to-reach reserves first. As the cost of extraction rises, the price of fossil fuels will rise, and we will use less of them. This will lead to a decrease in GHG emissions.\nThe demand theory for getting off fossil fuels suggests that as the cost of renewable energy sources (for electricity generation) and battery technology (for electric vehicles) falls, consumers will demand more of these technlogies, which are substitutes for conventional, fossil-fuel based technologies. This will lead to a shift outward in demand for low-GHG emissions technologies and a reduction in demand for high-GHG emissions technologies.\n\nRenewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime. Figure 5 shows the LCOE for different energy sources. Due in part to massive technological improvements in PV technology, renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, produce electricity more cheaply than conventional fossil fuel sources.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Levelized cost of electricity Source: By Mir-445511 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=137272269\n\n\nAt the same time, technological advancement led to the development of hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) and ability to access tar-sands oil which has made fossil fuels more abundant and, generally, cheaper. So, the same forces that drive down the cost of renewable energy sources are also driving down the cost of fossil fuels.\nFor battery technologies, technological advancements have also led to a notable decrease in the cost of batteries for electric vehciles. As shown in Figure 6, the cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen by 90% over the 30 years. Nissan Leaf batteries (40 kwh battery) cost ~$7300 in 2018. In 1991, it would have cost $300,000. This has made electric vehicles more cost-competitive with internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Cost of lithium-ion batteries Source: Our World in Data,"

See Figure 2 below for an example of how electricity is generated in Richard Scarry’s “Busytown.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Generating electricity from ``buried sunlight’’ in Busytown. Source: Richard Scarry, What Do People Do All Day?\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, just under 60% of electricity was generated by coal and natural gas in 2023. Nuclear accounted for 18% of electricity generation, while renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar, hydro) accounted for about 22% of generation. Renewables and nuclear do not emit greenhouse gases when generating electricity.\nIn the late 2000s through the 2010s, the share of electricity produced from natural gas increase considerably. This rise was due primarily to the abundance of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking). Fracking is a method of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that were previously inaccessible.\nTwo factors led to the dramatic reduction GHGs coming from the electricity sector. First, the shift from coal to natural gas has been a major driver of the decline in greenhouse gas emissions in the US, since natural gas emits less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than coal. Second, the rise of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, has also contributed to the decline in GHG emissions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sources of electricity generation in the US. Source: New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html\n\n\nAlthough renewable electricity generation is growing rapidly, renewables face intermittency issues. We can only generate solar electricity when the sun is shining and we can only generate wind electricity when the wind is blowing. Without large-scale battery storage, renewables are not perfect substitutes for fossil fuels.\nTo demonstrate one problem with intermittency, consider Figure 4 that shows the electricity generation in California over a 24-hour period. The “duck curve” shows that solar electricity generation peaks in the middle of the day when the sun is shining. As the sun sets, solar electricity generation falls off, and other sources of electricity generation must be used to meet demand. This increase in demand is typically met by natural gas-fired power plants, which have have costly “ramping” costs. The duck curve also demonstrates a problem: if I wanted to build a solar plant, who would I sell my electricity to during the middle of the day? The high penetration of solar, combined with the lack of electricity storage, leads weakens the incentives to invest in more solar capacity.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: California “duck curve”.

    "text": "micro review\nBefore we dive deeper into the economics of climate change, it will be useful to review some basic microeconomic concepts that will help understand how we model some of the problems from climate change with tools of supply and demand.\n\nindividual and market (or aggregate) demand\nIndividual demand curves reflect how much of a good—say, gasoline—that individual consumers are willing buy at any given price. Individual demand curves are plotted with quantity on the horizontal axis and price on thevertical axis. The slope of the demand curve reflects the marginal benefit of consuming an additional unit of the good. Demand curves slope downards because as the price of a good falls, consumers are willing to buy more of it. But, the demand curve also tells us how much people value additional consumption of the good. As quantity consumed rises, the marginal benefit of consuming an additional unit of the good falls. We call this diminishing marginal benefits.\nThe market or aggregate demand curve reflects the sum of all individual demand curves. Importantly, with private goods, we sum individual demand curves horizontally to get the market demand curve. Adding “horizontally” means that we add up all quantities demanded at each price level. In Table 1, we see that the market demand for gasoline is the sum of the individual demand curves for Person A, Person B, and Person C for any given price level.\n\n\nTable 1: Individual and market demand for gasoline\n\n\nPrice\nPerson A\nPerson B\nPerson C\nMarket\n\n\n\n\n$1\n5\n12\n7\n24\n\n\n$2\n4\n10\n6\n20\n\n\n$3\n3\n8\n5\n16\n\n\n$4\n2\n6\n4\n12\n\n\n$5\n1\n4\n3\n8\n\n\n$6\n0\n2\n2\n4\n\n\n$7\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nWe can also represent the market demand curve graphically. In Figure 3, we see that the market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves for Person A, Person B, and Person C. This is just the same information as in Table 1, but represented graphically.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Individual and market demand\n\n\nBuilding on this logic, we can go a step further and demonstrate these demand curves algebraically as well. We can define individual demand curves as follows:\n\n\\(MB_A(q) : p = 6 − q\\)\n\\(MB_B(q) : p = 7 − 0.5q\\)\n\\(MB_C(q) : p = 8 − q\\)\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the price per gallon of gasoline and \\(q\\) is the quantity of gasoline consumed.\nTo find the market or aggregate demand curve, we want to add the demand curves together, which we can represent as: \\(Q_{agg} = q_A + q_B + q_C\\). This is just the sum of the individual demand curves. To do this, we first solve each individual demand curve for \\(q\\):\n\n\\(q_A = 6 − p\\)\n\\(q_B = (7 − p)/0.5\\)\n\\(q_C = 8 − p\\)\n\nThis implies that \\(Q = (6 − p) + (7 − p)/0.5 + (8 − p)\\), which simplifies to \\(Q = 28 − 4p\\). Now, we can find the market demand curve by solving for \\(p\\), which gives us \\(p = 7 − Q/4\\). This is the market demand curve for gasoline that is represent in Figure 3.1\nIndividual and market supply curves work the same way, but they reflect the costs of producing goods and services. Supply curves will be upward sloping because as the price of a good rises, firms are willing to produce more of it. But, the supply curve also tells us how much it costs firms to produce additional units of the good. As quantity produced rises, the marginal cost of producing an additional unit of the good rises. We call this phenomenon diminishing marginal returns.\n\n\neconomic surplus\nAbove, we discussed how markets maximize net benefits by balancing the benefits of emissions abatement with the costs of doing so. This is a reflection of the concept of economic surplus. Economic surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus for any given quantity consumed and produced in a market.\nDemand curves reflect the consumer’s willingness to pay for a good at any quantity. Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good and what they actually pay, which is represented by the area between the demand curve and the price level. In Figure 4 (a), the vertical distance between the demand curve and the price level at \\(P\\) reflects the consumer surplus for that quantity level. For example, consumer surplus on the 4th gallon of gasoline is $6 - $3 = $3. If we calculate this vertical distance for every level of quantity, we get the aggregate measure of consumer surplus, which is the entire shaded between the demand curve and the price level up to the equilbrum quantity. We can easily calculate this area as the area of a triangle: \\(CS = 0.5 \\times (7-3) \\times 16 = \\$32\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Consumer surplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Producer surplus\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Consumer and producer surplus\n\n\nProducer surplus follows a similar description, although since supply curves represent marginal costs of producing a good, the producer surplus reflects the difference between what the seller receives for producing any quantity of goods less the costs of producing it. In Figure 4 (b), the vertical distance between the price level and the supply curve reflects the producer surplus for that quantity level. For example, producer surplus on the 8th gallon of gasoline is $3 - $2 = $1. If we calculate this vertical distance for every level of quantity, we get the aggregate measure of producer surplus, which is the entire shaded between the supply curve and the price level up to the equilibrium quantity. We can easily calculate this area as the area of a triangle: \\(PS = 0.5 \\times (3-1) \\times 16 = \\$16\\).\nThese concepts are helpful because consumers and producers are going to make decisions in their best interest that maximize their own economic surplus. Faced with any price, consumers will continue to purchase goods and services until the marginal benefit of consuming an additional unit of the good equals the price of the good. In other words, the consumer surplus of the last unit consumed will be zero. If consumers were to consume more, the price they would pay would be more than the benefit they would receive from consuming the good. Similarly, producers will continue to produce goods and services until the marginal cost of producing an additional unit of the good equals the price of the good. In other words, the producer surplus of the last unit produced will be zero. If producers were to produce more, the price they would receive would be less than the cost of producing the good.\nThis behavior means that consumers will keep consuming until \\(MB = p\\) and producers will keep producing until \\(MC = p\\). Because consumers and producers face the same price, we end up at the equilibrium quantity where \\(MB = MC\\). So, everyone acting in their own self-interest leads to an efficient allocation of resources. This discussion captures the essence of markets."

Because discounting compounds values over time, and GHG mitigation generates benefits over a long time horizon, small changes in the discount rate can have large impacts on the present value of future benefits.\nAs a reminder, the present value (PV) of a future value is calculated as: \\[PV(b) = \\frac{b}{(1 + r)^t}\\] where \\(b\\) is the nominal value, \\(r\\) is the discount rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years until the payment is received.\nImagine receiving a benefit of $1 million in 100 years.\n\nAt a 2% discount rate, the PV of that benefit is ~$138,000.\nAt a 3% discount rate, the PV of that benefit is ~$52,000.\nAt a 7% discount rate, the PV of that benefit is ~$1150.\n\nIf the cost of achieving that benefit were $100,000 today, it is easy to see how the project makes sense at a 2% discount rate, but not at a 3% or 7% discount rate.\nIn the interactive calculator below, choose a value and a time horizon in years to see how the discount rate affects the present value of a benefit received in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof discountRate = Inputs.range([0, 0.1], {value: 0.025, step: 0.005, label: \"discount rate\"});\nviewof timeHorizon = Inputs.range([1, 300], {value: 300, step: 1, label: \"time horizon (years)\"});\nviewof initialValue = Inputs.range([1000, 10000], {value: 1000, step: 1000, label: \"initial value\"});\n\ndiscountedValue = {\n  const data = [];\n  for (let t = 0; t &lt;= timeHorizon; t++) {\n    const discounted = initialValue / Math.pow(1 + discountRate, t);\n    data.push({year: t, value: discounted});\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n\nchart = {\n  const width = 600, height = 400;\n  const svg = html`&lt;svg width=${width} height=${height}&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;`;\n  \n  const margin = {top: 20, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 40};\n  const x = d3.scaleLinear()\n    .domain([0, timeHorizon])\n    .range([margin.left, width - margin.right]);\n\n  const y = d3.scaleLinear()\n    .domain([0, initialValue])\n    .nice()\n    .range([height - margin.bottom, margin.top]);\n\n  const xAxis = (g) =&gt; g\n    .attr(\"transform\", `translate(0,${height - margin.bottom})`)\n    .call(d3.axisBottom(x).ticks(width / 80).tickSizeOuter(0));\n\n  const yAxis = (g) =&gt; g\n    .attr(\"transform\", `translate(${margin.left},0)`)\n    .call(d3.axisLeft(y));\n\n  const line = d3.line()\n    .x(d =&gt; x(d.year))\n    .y(d =&gt; y(d.value));\n\n  d3.select(svg).selectAll(\"*\").remove(); // clear previous render\n\n  const g = d3.select(svg)\n    .append(\"g\");\n\n  g.append(\"g\").call(xAxis);\n  g.append(\"g\").call(yAxis);\n\n  g.append(\"path\")\n    .datum(discountedValue)\n    .attr(\"fill\", \"none\")\n    .attr(\"stroke\", \"steelblue\")\n    .attr(\"stroke-width\", 1.5)\n    .attr(\"d\", line);\n\n  return svg;\n}"

    "text": "empirical approach to estimating climate damages\nA recent wave of research has focused on how economic outcomes respond to changes in weather, and then they use that estimated relationship to project how those outcomes will change in the future with climate change. This approach is used to estimate weather-response functions. A simplified example of a weather-response function looks like this:\n\\[\ny = f(T)\n\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is some economic outcome (e.g., agricultural yields, labor productivity, electricity use, etc.) and \\(T\\) is some measure of weather (e.g., average temperature), and \\(f()\\) represents the shape of the relationship between weather and the economic outcome (e.g., electricity use might be quadratic in temperature because people use more electricity when it is very hot and very cold, but less electricity when it is mild).\nThese econometric weather-response functions can be useful tools to understanding how weather affects economic outcomes. But, there is (somewhat) limited ability for using historical data to understand how society will adapt to climate change. Adaptation would change the shape of \\(f()\\). If \\(y\\) is heat-related mortality, then the shape of \\(f()\\) might change as we society uses more air conditioning. That is, put simply, the relationship between temperature and mortality might be different in the future than it is today.\nIn Figure 4 below, two representative climates are shown on the left. The weather-response functions for electricity use are shown on the top right. The top panel shows the weather-response function with/without adaptation, while the bottom right panel shows the outcome, electricity consumption, based on different climate scenarios. The figure demonstrates that we can use fluctuations in “pre-climate change” weather to estimate the relationship between temperature and electricity use, this gives us the shape of the quadratic-looking weather-response function in the top right. Then, based on expectations of “post-climate change” weather (top left), we can project how electricity use will change in the future (bottom right). Comparing the outcomes with and without climate change gives us an estimate of the economic damages from climate change.\nThe challenge is understanding the degree to which the weather-response function will change in the future. With electricity use, we might expect that society will adapt to higher temperatures by using more air conditioning, which would change the shape of the weather-response function (as shown in the top right panel).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Emblematic weather-response functions with/without adaptation from Auffhammer (2018)\n\n\nWe can use some “cross-sectional” comparisons (i.e., giving the US Mexico’s climate) to understand how \\(f()\\) might change but these comparisons are limited because we cannot control for all of the other differences between the US and Mexico, such as income, culture, etc.\nThe empirical approach to estimating climate damages is a promising avenue for understanding the economic costs of climate change. But, it is not without limitations and challenges. Many have argued that\nMoreover, we can only estimate the relationship between temperature and outcomes for which we have good data. Certain outcomes, including a lot of non-market impacts of climate change, do not have good data precisely because they are not traded in markets."

This estimate is substantially larger than the $51/ton estimate previously used by the federal government. Part of this difference is due to the fact that the new estimate uses a 2% discount rate, while the previous estimate used a 3% discount rate.

    "text": "Marginal abatement costs\nBecause comparing policies reduces to comparing costs, it is useful for us to revisit the marginal abatement cost curve. Marginal abatement costs (MACs) are the costs of reducing each additional emission of a pollutant. MACs reflect the minimum cost of achieving each unit of abatement (i.e., you always want to reduce the cheapest GHGs first). Think of switching from incandescent to LED lightbulbs, this technological switch is actually negative cost because the efficiency improvement pays for itself. As we move “up” the MAC curve, we are reducing GHG emissions at an increasing cost. Building a new nuclear power plant to offset coal might reduce emissions, but does so at a very high incremental cost.\nWe can plot MACs either in terms of abatement or emissions. If we plot MAC curves in terms of abatement, we can think of the MAC curve as the supply curve for GHG abatement, which is upward sloping. If we plot MAC curves in terms of emissions, we can think of the MAC curve as the demand curve for GHG emissions, which is downward sloping."

    "text": "Command-and-control policies\nThere are two primary types of policies to reduce GHG emissions: “Command-and-control” policies and market-based policies. Command-and-control policies are regulations that require firms to reduce emissions by a certain amount. Market-based policies are policies that create incentives for firms to reduce emissions.\nTwo types of command-and-control policies are performance standards and technology standards.\n\nPerformance standards\nFor performance standards, the regulator (often the government) sets the amount GHG pollution that is allowed from each firm. A useful example is when the regulator sets the total emissions cap and then allows each firm to emit equal amounts. This is called a uniform performance standard (e.g., if there are \\(N\\) regulated firms and the regulator chooses an emissions cap of \\(\\bar{E}\\), then each firm would be allowed to emit no more than \\(\\bar{E}/N\\).) In general, emissions standards are relatively easy to implement and monitor: the regulator only needs to choose an emissions level and require firms to report their emissions, which can be enforced via penalities if firms violate the standard. Because the regulator typically does not observe marginal abatement costs for each firm (or in aggregate), they have to set emissions caps with imperfect information. In general, this results in reducing industry-wide emissions in a costlier manner than alternative market-based based policies.\n\n\nTechnology standards\nFor technology standards, the regulator chooses the technology that a firm must use to reduce GHG emissions. With technology standards, rather than choosing an emissions level, the regulator might mandate all firms to use the “best available” technology. This policy might help some under-performing firms with information asymmetry, but it might also increase costs for some firms. In general, technology standards could be more or less costly than performance standards in meeting a given emissions target."

    "text": "Market-based policies\nCommand-and-control policies are generally inefficient (or more costly) because they are rather blunt tools to reducing emissions. Market-based policies can be more efficient because they create incentives for firms to reduce emissions in the least costly way. There are two primary types of market-based policies: taxes and cap-and-trade programs.\n\nCorrective taxes\nCorrective, or “Pigouvian,” taxes are taxes on the production or consumption of a good that generates negative externalities. Corrective taxes are designed to internalize the external costs of production or consumption. In the case of GHG emissions, a corrective tax is often referred to as a carbon tax.\nThe idea behind a carbon tax is straightforward. We want to reduce GHG emissions, so we tax GHG emissions. This tax increases the marginal cost of GHG emissions, which shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax. This results in a new equilibrium level of emissions, which is lower than the original level of emissions. The tax is set to the level that achieves the socially optimal level of emissions. This is the level of emissions that maximizes net benefits (i.e., the level of emissions where the marginal benefits of emissions abatement equal the marginal costs of emissions abatement).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example carbon tax on gasoline\n\n\nConsider Figure 1, which shows an example carbon tax in the market for gasoline. The supply curve reflects the marginal cost of producing gasoline. If suppliers of gasoline do not have to account for the externalities that arise from burning gasoline, they will sell 500 gallons/year at a price of $3.50/gallon. Gasoline generates emissions of GHGs, which impose costs on society in terms of climate change. For each gallon of gasoline consumed, the external costs are $2/gallon. We can add this marginal damage to the supply curve to get the social marginal cost curve. The socially optimal amount of gasoline consumption/production occurs at the intersection of the demand curve and the marginal social cost curve. In order to achieve this level of consumption, the government can implement a tax of $2/gallon. This tax will increase the marginal cost of gasoline production by $2/gallon. This will result in a new equilibrium level of consumption of 400 gallons/year at a price (to consumers) of $5/gallon. Producers, on the other hand, will only receive $3/gallon of gasoline sold.\nBut, if consumers pay $5/gallon and producers receive $3/gallon, where did the other $2/gallon go? This amount is the per-gallon tax revenue the government receives. In this example, consumers’s tax burden ($5.00 - $3.50) \\(\\times\\) 400 = $600, whereas the producers’ tax burden is ($3.50 - $3.00) \\(\\times\\) 400 = $200. The total tax burden is $800, which is the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 1. This tax burden is the total amount of tax revenue the government receives. The amount of the tax that consumers/producers pay depends on the slope of the demand curve. With very elastic demand, consumers can shift consumption to close substitute goods, which means that producers will bear most of the tax burden. With very inelastic demand, consumers cannot shift consumption to close substitute goods, which means that consumers will bear most of the tax burden.\nTaxes also generate deadweight loss, which is shaded in gray in Figure 1. This area reflects lost consumer and producer surplus in the market. This DWL is not necessarily a bad thing. It reflects the fact that we are reducing consumption of a good that generates negative externalities. In setting the tax, we’ve eliminated the DWL that would have resulted from overconsumption of gasoline (not show in the figure).\nThe key point with carbon taxes is that they force consumers and producers to internalize the external costs of GHG emissions. Moreover, taxes generate revenue. The government can use that revenue to reduce other taxes, invest in clean energy, or provide other public goods. One major concern about the political viability of carbon taxes is that they increase the cost of carbon-intensive goods and services (imagine paying $1.50 more for each gallon of gasoline). This is a legitimate concern, but governments can use that tax revenue to mitigate distributional concerns. For example, the government could rebate all of the carbon tax revenue back to households.\n\nCost effectiveness of carbon taxes\nTaxes can achieve emissions reductions at a lower cost than alternative policies. To see this, consider two firms (A and B) facing a GHG price \\(\\tau^\\star\\) in Figure 2. In this figure, the width of the horizontal axis is fixed at the total level of emissions reductions needed in the the market (comprised of only the two firms). So, if we operate all the way on the left, then firm A produces all of the GHG abatement. If we operate all the way on the right, then firm B produces all of the GHG abatement. If we operate somewhere in the middle, then both firms produce some level of the required GHG abatement. When a tax on GHG emissions is set, each firm is going to abate GHG emissions up to the point where the tax equals their MAC curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cost effectiveness of carbon taxes\n\n\nIn Figure 2, firm B abates relatively more emissions than firm A, because they have a lower MAC curve. That is, Firm B can abate emissions more cheaply, so they contribute more overall abatement. From a societal perspective, this is a good thing: we want emissions to be reduced in the cheapest way possible. To calculate the overall cost of emissions reductions under the tax, we would calculate the area underneath each MAC curve up to the point of abatement.\n\n\n\nCap-and-trade programs\nCap-and-trade programs are market-based policies that set a limit (or, “cap”) on the total amount of GHG emissions that are allowed to be produced. The regulator then issues a number of permits that are equal to the cap. One permit gives firms the right to emit one ton of GHGs. The government then distributes the allowances to permits (either freely or through an auction). Firms can then trade allowances with each other. Firms that can reduce emissions at a low cost can sell their allowances to firms that cannot reduce emissions at a low cost. This creates a market for GHG emissions. The price of allowances is determined by the supply and demand for allowances. The government can set the cap at a level that achieves the socially optimal level of emissions, and then firms can trade allowances so that the emissions reduction is met at least cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Initial allocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Final allocation\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of cap-and-trade program.\n\n\nIn Figure 3, imagine that the regulator freely allocates an equal number of permits to each firm (represented by point \\(a_0\\)). At this level of abatement, firm B has MAC = \\(p^B\\) and firm A has MAC = \\(p^A\\), where \\(p^A &gt; p^B\\). Because the marginal cost of abating one more ton of GHGs is cheaper for firm B than it is for firm A, firm A should be willing to purchase a permit from firm B rather than abating their last unit of GHGs. Once this transaction occurs, then the process repeats itself until the marginal cost of abatement is equalized across firms. The firms will trade until they reach point \\(a^\\star\\), which is the socially optimal level of abatement. The price of permits is equal to the marginal cost of abatement for both firms. Notably, the equilibrium permit price is identical to the carbon tax that would achieve the same level of abatement. The cost of acheiving the emissions reductions is minimized, just like with a carbon tax.\nCap-and-trade programs can also raise revenue if the permits are initially auctioned off. If permits are allocated freely, then all of this revenue is retained within the regulated market. Often, permits are granted based on historical emissions and given to firms for free. This is often done to reduce the political opposition to cap-and-trade programs. But, this can also result in windfall profits for firms that receive permits for free.\nA few primary examples of cap-and-trade programs are:\n\nThe European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)\nThe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)\nCalifornia’s cap-and-trade program"

    "text": "Prices vs. quantities\nWhen setting policies, the regulator typically does not know firms’ individual MACs or even the industry-wide aggregate MAC. Because of this information assymmetry, the regulator often has to set policies with imperfect information, which can lead to setting a tax too high or too low or setting a emissions cap too stringent or too lax. Both of these scenarios can result in inefficient, or costlier, outcomes.\nWith uncertainty (or, more concretely, imperfect information), it is often useful to think about the tradeoffs between setting a price (e.g., a tax) and setting a quantity (e.g., an emissions cap). Weitzman’s classic 1974 article provides a general rule for when we should prefer a price-based policy (e.g., a tax) vs. a quantity-based policy (e.g., a cap-and-trade policy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Steep marginal benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Flat marginal benefits\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Comparing prices and quantities\n\n\nFirst, focus on the left-hand side of Figure 5, which shows a steep marginal benefit curve. Consider the scenario where the regulator sets policy based on expected aggregate MAC, E[MAC]. The quantity cap they would set is where E[MAC] = MB. But, we actually experience the MAC\\(_H\\) curve, so the regulator has set cap incorrectly. They would have preferred to set the cap at \\(a^\\star\\). So, the regulator required a level of GHG abatement greater than what was socially optimal because they had to set policy without knowing the true MAC curve. How much social cost have they imposed on society? The area of the shaded green triangle is the area of DWL that is imposed from having set an incorrect cap.\nSimilarly, still focusing on the left-hand side of Figure 5, imagine the regulator also wants to set a tax based on E[MAC]. They choose a tax \\(\\tau_0\\), which generates too little abatement. Without uncertainty, the regulator would have set the tax at the intersection of the MAC\\(_H\\) curve and the MB curve. But, because they have imperfect information, they set the tax too low, resulting in too little abatement. This results in a DWL that is the area of the shaded red triangle.\nAs is clear from the figure, the DWL from setting the cap too low is larger than the DWL from setting the tax too low. This means that getting the tax rate wrong is more costly than getting quantities wrong in this instance. This result is driven by the steepness of the MB curve. If the MB curve were flatter (see right-hand side of Figure 5), then the DWL from setting the cap too low would be relatively larger, and the DWL from setting the tax too low would be relatively smaller.\nSo, the general Weitzman rule is that if the MB curve is steep (relative to the MAC curve), then we should prefer a quantity-based policy (e.g., a cap-and-trade program). If the MB curve is flat (relative to the MAC curve), then we should prefer a price-based policy (e.g., a tax). Another way to say this is that if it’s a bigger deal to get quantities wrong, we should prefer a quantity policy. If it’s a bigger deal to get prices wrong, we should prefer a price policy.\nFor climate change, we tend to fall into the “flat” MB scenario. Reducing emissions a little bit within a year is unlikely to dramatically change the overall level of climate change, so we should prefer a price-based policy. This is one reason why economists tend to prefer carbon taxes over cap-and-trade programs for climate change."

    "text": "performance standards\nFor performance standards, the regulator (often the government) sets the amount GHG pollution that is allowed from each firm. A useful example is when the regulator sets the total emissions cap and then allows each firm to emit equal amounts. This is called a uniform performance standard (e.g., if there are \\(N\\) regulated firms and the regulator chooses an emissions cap of \\(\\bar{E}\\), then each firm would be allowed to emit no more than \\(\\bar{E}/N\\).) In general, emissions standards are relatively easy to implement and monitor: the regulator only needs to choose an emissions level and require firms to report their emissions, which can be enforced via penalities if firms violate the standard. Because the regulator typically does not observe marginal abatement costs for each firm (or in aggregate), they have to set emissions caps with imperfect information. In general, this results in reducing industry-wide emissions in a costlier manner than alternative market-based based policies."

In general, technology standards could be more or less costly than performance standards in meeting a given emissions target."

    "section": "corrective taxes",
    "text": "corrective taxes\nCorrective, or “Pigouvian,” taxes are taxes on the production or consumption of a good that generates negative externalities. Corrective taxes are designed to internalize the external costs of production or consumption. In the case of GHG emissions, a corrective tax is often referred to as a carbon tax.\nCarbon taxes punish bad behavior, similar to a “swear jar.” For an absolutely fantastic discussion of how carbon taxes work within this analogy, check out this video by University of Michigan professor Catherine Hausman:\n\nThe idea behind a carbon tax is straightforward. We want to reduce GHG emissions, so we tax goods that generate GHG emissions. This tax increases the marginal cost of those goods that generate GHG externalities, which shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax. This results in a new equilibrium level of consumption and production, which is lower than the original level in the private market equilibrium. The tax level is set equal to the marginal external damages that are generated by the polluting good, which then internalizes the external cost and achieves the socially optimal level of production. This is the level of production and consumption that maximizes net benefits.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example carbon tax on gasoline\n\n\nConsider Figure 1, which shows an example carbon tax in the market for gasoline. The supply curve reflects the marginal cost of producing gasoline. If suppliers of gasoline do not have to account for the externalities that arise from burning gasoline, they will sell 500 gallons/year at a price of $3.50/gallon. Burning gasoline emits GHGs, which impose costs on society via climate change. For each gallon of gasoline consumed, assume the external costs are $2/gallon.1 We can add this marginal damage to the supply curve to get the social marginal cost curve. The socially optimal amount of gasoline consumption/production occurs at the intersection of the demand curve and the marginal social cost curve. In order to achieve this level of consumption, the government can implement a tax of $2/gallon. This tax will increase the marginal cost of gasoline production by $2/gallon. This will result in a new equilibrium level of consumption of 400 gallons/year at a price (to consumers) of $5/gallon. Producers, on the other hand, will only receive $3/gallon for each gallon sold.\nBut, if consumers pay $5/gallon and producers receive $3/gallon, where did the other $2/gallon go? This amount is the per-gallon tax revenue the government receives. In this example, consumers’s tax burden ($5.00 - $3.50) \\(\\times\\) 400 = $600, whereas the producers’ tax burden is ($3.50 - $3.00) \\(\\times\\) 400 = $200. The total tax burden is $800, which is the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 1. This tax burden is the total amount of tax revenue the government receives. The amount of the tax that consumers/producers pay depends on the relative slopes of the demand and supply curves. With very elastic demand, consumers can shift consumption to close substitute goods, which means that producers will bear most of the tax burden. With very inelastic demand, consumers cannot shift consumption to close substitute goods, which means that consumers will bear most of the tax burden.\nTaxes also generate deadweight loss, which is shaded in gray in Figure 1. This area reflects lost consumer and producer surplus in the market. This DWL is not necessarily a bad thing. It reflects the fact that we are reducing consumption of a good that generates negative externalities. In setting the tax, we’ve eliminated the DWL that would have resulted from overconsumption of gasoline (not shown in the figure).\nThe key point with carbon taxes is that they force consumers and producers to internalize the external costs of GHG emissions. Moreover, taxes generate revenue. The government can use that revenue to reduce other taxes, invest in clean energy, or provide other public goods. One major concern about the political viability of carbon taxes is that they increase the cost of carbon-intensive goods and services (imagine paying $1.50 more for each gallon of gasoline). This is a legitimate concern, but governments can use that tax revenue to mitigate distributional concerns. For example, the government could rebate all of the carbon tax revenue back to households.\n\ncost-effectiveness of carbon taxes\nTaxes can achieve emissions reductions at a lower cost than alternative policies. To see this, consider two firms (A and B) facing a GHG price \\(\\tau^\\star\\) in Figure 2. In this figure, the width of the horizontal axis is fixed at the total level of emissions reductions needed in the the market (comprised of only the two firms). So, if we operate all the way on the left, then firm A produces all of the GHG abatement. If we operate all the way on the right, then firm B produces all of the GHG abatement. If we operate somewhere in the middle, then both firms produce some level of the required GHG abatement. When a tax on GHG emissions is set, each firm is going to abate GHG emissions up to the point where the tax equals their MAC curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cost effectiveness of carbon taxes\n\n\nIn Figure 2, firm B abates relatively more emissions than firm A, because they have a lower MAC curve. That is, Firm B can abate emissions more cheaply, so they contribute more overall abatement. From a societal perspective, this is a good thing: we want emissions to be reduced in the cheapest way possible. To calculate the overall cost of emissions reductions under the tax, we would calculate the area underneath each MAC curve up to the point of abatement.\n\n\nexamples of carbon taxes\n\nBritish Columbia’s Carbon Tax\nSweden’s Carbon Tax"

    "text": "cap-and-trade programs\nCap-and-trade programs are market-based policies that set a limit (or, “cap”) on the total amount of GHG emissions that are allowed to be produced. The regulator then issues a number of permits that are equal to the cap. One permit gives firms the right to emit one ton of GHGs. The government then distributes the allowances to permits (either freely or through an auction). Firms can then trade allowances with each other. Firms that can reduce emissions at a low cost can sell their allowances to firms that cannot reduce emissions at a low cost. This creates a market for GHG emissions. The price of allowances is determined by the supply and demand for allowances. The government can set the cap at a level that achieves the socially optimal level of emissions, and then firms can trade allowances so that the emissions reduction is met at least cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Initial allocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Final allocation\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of cap-and-trade program.\n\n\nIn Figure 3, imagine that the regulator freely allocates an equal number of permits to each firm (represented by point \\(a_0\\)). At this level of abatement, firm B has MAC = \\(p^B\\) and firm A has MAC = \\(p^A\\), where \\(p^A &gt; p^B\\). Because the marginal cost of abating one more ton of GHGs is cheaper for firm B than it is for firm A, firm A should be willing to purchase a permit from firm B rather than abating their last unit of GHGs. Once this transaction occurs, then the process repeats itself until the marginal cost of abatement is equalized across firms. The firms will trade until they reach point \\(a^\\star\\), which is the socially optimal level of abatement. The price of permits is equal to the marginal cost of abatement for both firms. Notably, the equilibrium permit price is identical to the carbon tax that would achieve the same level of abatement. The cost of acheiving the emissions reductions is minimized, just like with a carbon tax.\nCap-and-trade programs can also raise revenue if the permits are initially auctioned off. If permits are allocated freely, then all of this revenue is retained within the regulated market. Often, permits are granted based on historical emissions and given to firms for free. This is often done to reduce the political opposition to cap-and-trade programs. But, this can also result in windfall profits for firms that receive permits for free.\n\nexamples of cap-and-trade programs\n\nThe European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)\nThe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)\nCalifornia’s Cap-and-Trade Orogram"
