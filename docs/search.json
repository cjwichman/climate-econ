Switching from coal to natural gas might reduce emissions relatively cheaply for electricity production. But, switching from natural gas to renewables is more expensive.

The first few billion tons of emissions abated per year might reduce the risk of a catastrophic climate event (e.g., keeping global surface temperatures below, say, 3 degrees). But, as we reduce emissions further, the benefits of additional abatement become smaller (e.g., moving from 2 degrees of warming to 1.5 degrees warming still generates benefits, but fewer than moving from 3.5 to 3 degrees of warming).

    "text": "externalities\nExternalities: An externality results when the actions of one individual (or firm) have a direct, unintentional, and uncompensated effect on the well-being of other individuals or the profits of other firms.\nExternalities can be positive or negative. In the case of GHG emissions, the externality is negative because the costs of emissions are not reflected in the prices we pay for goods and services. This augments our standard demand model when were thinking about, say, the market for gasoline consumption.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The market for gasoline with externalities\n\n\nConsider Figure 3, the private equilibrium level is \\(Q^{private}\\) and \\(P^{private}\\) where the supply (or private marginal cost) curve and the demand (or private marginal benefit) curve intersect. But, we know gasoline consumption generates externalities. The marginal social cost curve reflects the total costs to society that are associated with gasoline consumption (inclusive of GHG emissions). Those externalities are represented by the vertical difference between the private marginal cost curve and the social marginal cost curve, which is called the marginal external damages of gasoline consumption.\n\nOperating at the privately optimal point of consumption results in deadweight loss to society, which reflects the social welfare loss of failure to incorporate external costs into the price of gasoline. Deadweight loss is the welfare loss borne by people outside of the market.\nIf we were to incorporate the social cost of gasoline consumption into the price of gasoline, the supply curve would shift up by the amount of the marginal external damages. This would result in a new equilibrium level of consumption, \\(Q^{social}\\) and \\(P^{social}\\). At this point, consumers would have to pay more (in this case, 5 dollars per gallon) and suppliers would receive less than \\(P^{private}\\).\nMoving from \\(Q^{private}\\) to \\(Q^{social}\\) would also reduce producer and consumer surplus (the areas shaded in green). This makes sense: consumers are getting fewer benefits from gasoline, and producers are receiving less profit. So, there are “losers” when we move to the socially efficient allocation, despite the fact that society as a whole is better off."

    "text": "public goods\nOne primary reason that markets fail to account for the social costs of GHG emissions is that GHG mitigation is a public good. If the US were to abate GHG emissions, the benefits would be shared by everyone in the world. But, the costs of abatement would be borne by US citizens. As a result, the US has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of other countries to reduce emissions.\nPublic goods are characterized by two key features:\n\nNon-rivalry: One person’s consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others to consume.\nNon-excludability: Others cannot be excluded from consuming the good.\n\nExamples of pure public goods include clean air, national defense, Wikipedia, and so forth.\nPrivate goods are rivalrous and excludable. I can exclude you from consuming my private goods (e.g., the peanut butter and jelly sandwich I eat on most days for lunch). And, if I consume my car, you cannot consume it.\nTwo other classes of goods are relevant for our purposes:\n\nCommon pool resources: Common pool resources are rivalrous but non-excludable. For example, fish in the ocean are rivalrous because if I catch a fish, you cannot catch it. But, the ocean is non-excludable because it is impossible to prevent people from fishing in the ocean.\nClub goods: Club goods are non-rivalrous but excludable. For example, a private park is non-rivalrous because if I am in the park, you can also be in the park. But, the park is excludable because I can prevent you from entering the park.\n\nWhen modeling equilibrium supply of public goods, we need to account for the nonrival nature of public goods. In Figure 4, there are two marginal benefit curves for different people that reflect how much they value trips to a national forest for hiking or camping. Because both people can simultaneously enjoy the national forest, we need to add up their marginal benefits curves vertically to understand the aggregate benefits that each quantity of trips provides.1 This vertical summation results in the social marginal benefit curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Modeling public goods\n\n\nThe supply curve reflects the marginal cost of that the government bears in providing the public good (e.g., trail maintenance, campsite development, and so forth). If the government were to only consider the private marginal benefits of the public good, they might provide \\(Q_b\\), which reflects person B’s demand for trips. But, if the government were to consider the social marginal benefits of the public good, they would provide \\(Q^\\star\\), which reflects the sum of person A and person B’s demand for trips (i.e., the total willingness to pay for trips to the national forest)."

Climate change is no different. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves, tropical cyclones, drought (which can lead to crop failure and food insecurity), forest fires, and so forth. These events will increase the risk of death for people around the world. Reducing GHG emissions will reduce the risk of these events, which will reduce the risk of death. One way to value that benefit is to use the value of a statistical life (VSL) (also known as the value of mortality risk reductions). The VSL is the amount of money that a person is willing to pay to reduce their risk of death by a small amount. The way it is calculated is as follows. Imagine gathering 100,000 people. Then, ask each of them how much they would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of death by 1 in 100,000 that year.1 If the average person is willing to pay $100 for a reducing the risk of death by 0.001%, then we would multiply the average person’s willingness to pay by 100,000 to arrive at a VSL estimate of $10,000,000. This value is approximately the current value used by the US government to value mortality risk reductions."

The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would need to be invested today at a given interest rate to yield that future payment.\nWe calculate the PV of a single value in the future using the following formula:\n\\[PV(b) = \\frac{b}{(1 + r)^t}\\]\nwhere \\(b\\) is the future value of the payment, \\(r\\) is the discount rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years until the payment is received. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of money in the future.\nWe can also calculate the PV of a stream of future benefits using the following formula:\n\\[PV(b_t) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{b_t}{(1 + r)^t}\\]\nwhere \\(b_t\\) is the amount of benefits received in each year \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) is the total number of years over which benefits are received. This is the same as the single period formula, but we repeat that formula for each year benefits accrue.\nNote, you can also calculate the PV of a stream of future costs using a “continuous time” version of the formula:\n\\[PV(b_t) = b_t \\exp(-rt)\\]\nThe basic idea behind discounting is that we are impatient. We would prefer to receive money now, rather than in the future. So, we discount future benefits and costs to reflect our degree of impatience. This idea stems from the fact that we can earn interest on money today. With a 5% interest rate, we should be indifferent between $100 today and $105 a year from now, because we could invest that $100 and earn $5 of interest payments in one year. Discounting just reverses that same idea. Nominal dollar amounts received in the future will be worth less than nominal dollar amounts received today."

The 2007 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change used a social discount rate of 1.4%.

But, there is (somewhat) limited ability for using historical data to understand how society will adapt to climate change. Adaptation would change the shape of \\(f()\\). If \\(y\\) is heat-related mortality, then the shape of \\(f()\\) might change as we society uses more air conditioning. That is, put simply, the relationship between temperature and mortality might be different in the future than it is today.\nWe can use some “cross-sectional” comparisons (i.e., giving the US Mexico’s climate) to understand how \\(f()\\) might change but these comparisons are limited because we cannot control for all of the other differences between the US and Mexico.\nMoreover, we can only estimate the relationship between temperature and outcomes for which we have good data.
